Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives. Banking, navigation, social media, note taking, contacts, etc which are very personal and deal with money, privacy and safety are being done on smartphones. 

#### But how secure are in reality?

The answer is a big **ZERO**. We lack both privacy and security in all aspects across all devices.

One of the biggest misconceptions is that iOS is very secure and unbreakable.

iOS is closed source and has a tightly controlled environment because of which malicious apps and other system exploits are "rarer".
This is comparatively better for the average users. But what many people fail to understand is that

1. Rarer doesn't mean its more secure
2. You can't call a system secure if you have no clue what's happening underneath

If having a closed source OS with tightly controlled environment makes you feel safe, you should ditch iOS and use Blackberry, or Windows or any other non popular OS.

As of today, 85% of smartphones run on Android, and 13.28% on iOS ([source](https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/operating-systems-market-share/)).

The number of severe vulnerabilities publicly reported are:

Android: [828](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=49&product_id=15556&version_id=&page=1&hasexp=0&opdos=0&opec=0&opov=0&opcsrf=0&opgpriv=0&opsqli=0&opxss=0&opdirt=0&opmemc=0&ophttprs=0&opbyp=0&opfileinc=0&opginf=0&cvssscoremin=9&cvssscoremax=0&year=0&month=0&cweid=0&order=1&trc=1655&sha=1efc6556e916c71709f3dc8581fc744a48152068)

Its tempting to conclude that Android is the most insecure OS amongst the above four. But that would be just poor logic.

Android which has 6.5 times the user base, and also completely open source has only 3 times more vulnerabilities than iOS. And iOS which is considered to be practically safe has significant portition of vulnerabilities under its belt. As a matter of fact, you can blindly trust any widely used open source project to be the most secure. Why?

1. Any exploit will be exposed to the world as soon as possible
2. The corresponding fix will also be

Considering Windows and Blackberry, they are neither more secure than iOS nor Android. What it means is that nobody has the motivation to exploit them.
